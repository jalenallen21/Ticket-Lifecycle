The osTicket in the picture states the problem the user is having with the computer and what time the ticket was created so you can fix the issue in a timely manner. It also shows the status of the ticket, shows the SLA agreement as well as who the ticket is assigned too and what time.

This stage is where you can contact the user regarding the issues on their computer. This helps communicate the problem and gives the user ability to contact you if the problem is still occuring or if the problem has been fixed. Communicating with the user to inform them is very important when the problem has been resolved.
